    | VECTOR_WIDTH        | Vector utilization           |
    | ------------- |:-------------:|
    | 2     | 84.8% |
    | 4     | 79.9% |
    | 8     | 77.4% |
    | 16     | 76.2% |

    The vector utilization decreases as VECTOR_WIDTH increase, because more vector instructions
    are used to calculate all vector values' exponent as vector size increases, given than exponent
    values are varying within one vector.
